# MagneticEigenMaps

This repository stores demo scripts to visualize some artificial directed networks thanks to Magnetic Eigenmaps.


The reference paper is
[Magnetic Eigenmaps for the visualization of directed networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1063520317300052) by Michaël Fanuel, Carlos M. Alaíz, Ángela Fernández, Johan A. K. Suykens.

Note that the artificial networks in this demo are not exactly the same as in the paper.
